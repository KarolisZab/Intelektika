-------------------------------- CHATGPT DESCRIPTION:

This code performs k-means clustering and generates various visualizations related to the clustering process. Here is a breakdown of the code:

The code defines a function called centroids(K, b) that performs k-means clustering. It takes two arguments: K (the number of clusters) and b (a column name from the DataFrame).

Within the centroids() function, initial centroids are randomly selected from the DataFrame using the sample() function. The clustering process is performed iteratively until the centroids converge. The algorithm calculates the Euclidean distance between each data point and the centroids and assigns the data points to the nearest centroid.

After clustering, the code calculates silhouette coefficients for each cluster. Silhouette coefficient measures the compactness and separation of clusters. The code also calculates the total inertia, which is the sum of squared distances between data points and their respective cluster centroids.

The code includes various plotting functions, such as plot_silhouette_graphs() and plot_inertia(), which generate visualizations related to clustering results, including silhouette plots and inertia plots.

The code contains a loop that iterates over different values of K (number of clusters) and calls the centroids() function for each K value, generating the corresponding visualizations.

There are commented sections that provide examples of how to use the plot_inertia() function and calculate inertia for specific columns.

Overall, the code performs k-means clustering on the given dataset and visualizes the results using scatter plots, silhouette plots, and inertia plots. The specific columns used for clustering and visualization can be modified by changing the values of column, b, and rows variables.
